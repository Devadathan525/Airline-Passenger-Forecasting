# Airline Passengers Traffic Forecasting using ARIMA Model

### Introduction
To implemenet Airline Passengers Traffic Forecasting using ARIMA Model for next 5 years for helping our Travel Agency. 

### ARIMA Model

An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends. A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values.

What is ARIMA used for?
It's used in statistics and econometrics to measure events that happen over a period of time.

Why ARIMA is used for forecasting?
ARIMA models use differencing to convert a non-stationary time series into a stationary one, and then predict future values from historical data. These models use “auto” correlations and moving averages over residual errors in the data to forecast future values.

### Tools Used
Python - Model Building 

### Forecasting 5 year Traffic
